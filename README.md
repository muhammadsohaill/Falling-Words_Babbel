# Falling-Words_Babbel

Total Time Spent: 3-3:30 Hours due to strict working hours of my current job

Spent 30 hour to create the plan and choosing which technologies to use.
Spend around 30 minutes to make the UI for each navigation screen.
In around next 1:30 hour I took online help as well and finalized the code functionality and got the game up and running using provided json data.

Things which could not be Improved due to shortage of time:
I would have used Retrofit with live data to get Word data from API call to keep the app updatedwith the new data.
I would have used Lottie or any other animation to make the app UX much better.
I would not have taken help from online sources but I did not even have 4 hours to keep my mind mind away from current office project.
